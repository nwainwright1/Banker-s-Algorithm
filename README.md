# Banker-s-Algorithm
By: Nathaniel Wainwright

# Main Idea
This program simulates the Banker's Algorithm. The Banker's Algorithm is used to avoid deadlocks when there are multiple processes running using the same resources. This program will read the information from the input.txt. When compiling this program, make sure the input.txt and the banker.cpp are in the same folder.

# Compile and Run
In linux terminal:

$ clang++ -std=c++11 banker.cpp

$ ./a.out

# Output
